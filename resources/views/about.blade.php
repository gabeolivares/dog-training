        <h3>Candi-La'Rue Smith- Owner</h4>
        <p>
          Destined to actively work with dogs, Candi was inspired to tailor to
          dogs needs as a young girl. Accompanied with 4 adorable cats, 2 loyal German Shepherds, and a lovable
          Retriever- Candi's lifestyle is naturally about caring for animals.  Training and working with dogs since
          the age of 12, she is experienced, professional, and knowledgeable. "Growing up I always told my mom I
          wanted a piece of land to have dogs come over and slumber with me when their parents went out of town."
          Customizing a broad range of extra curricular programs for dogs to enjoy while being away from home.
          With successfully training over 100 dogs, expert in behavior modification, and dog socialization- her
          small business has flourished.
