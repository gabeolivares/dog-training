    <h2>Why Would My Dog Need Daycare?</h2>
    <p>
      Daycare is the best alternative to leaving your dog home alone.
      Dogs that are left at home lack the exercise and socialization that they need to be happy,
      healthy pets! Dogs may also suffer from separation anxiety or engage in undesirable behaviors
      such as excessive chewing or barking out of boredom. Daycare is also a great alternative
      when you have the cable guy, housekeeper, baby sitter, inspector, landscaper, etc coming over during the day.
      Daycare provides your dogs with a safe, fun, and engaging atmosphere where they can
      spend the day running, playing and socializing with other dogs. Let your dog be a dog
      with certified professionals at The Barkin' Bones Inn.
